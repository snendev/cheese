## Cheese Rolling: Forever

This is a game made for Bevy Jam #4. It is inspired by the Cooper's Hill Cheese Rolling and Wake.
Players roll down a hill as a wheel of cheese and dodge the ragdolls falling from above.


Playable on [itch.io](https://snendev.itch.io/cheese-rolling-forever) or my
[lab](https://lab.snen.dev/cheese). Prebuilt versions are available on the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/snendev/cheese-rolling-forever/releases).

### Controls

Use the Left and Right keys (or the A and D keys) to move in that direction.

Hold Space to look backward (up the hill).
